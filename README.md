**Webstagram**

I use Instagram as part of a volunteer organization I work for - the one caveat is that I
don't have Instagram on my phone (and I try to limit my work apps on my phone), and I can't
publish new posts on desktop without either needing an emulator or having to use a hacky method
by way of Google Chrome's Developer Tools.

So I'm building Webstagram. The Instagram experience, on your desktop.

I am not affiliated with Instagram, I am not making money off of this project.

I am only doing it to practice my Frontend/Backend skills*.

*However, Instagram, if you see this and you like it, I'm looking for employement. 

## Frontend

_(This project uses React as its frontend framework)_

I'm building the frontend in three parts:

-Skeleton
-Styling
-Functionality

**1: Skeleton**
One of my struggles is that I try to do too much, too soon. So I'm using the Instagram desktop view
as a model for my skeleton, where I'll build out the pages I need and want for this project.

**2: Styling**
I really, really struggle with styling, so I'll work on my css skills next so I can make the page look as much like the original product. Every page will come with a disclaimer "This is not Instagram, please do not use any real credentials here". I'm not planning on hosting this anyway.

**3: Functonality**
Save the best for last, and my strongest skill is that I'm really, really good at functionality. So I'll save this part once everything else is done the way I want.
