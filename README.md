**Webstagram**

I use Instagram as part of a volunteer organization I work for - the one caveat is that I
don't have Instagram on my phone (and I try to limit my work apps on my phone), and I can't
publish new posts on desktop without either needing an emulator or having to use a hacky method
by way of Google Chrome's Developer Tools.

So I'm building Webstagram. The Instagram experience, on your desktop.

I am not affiliated with Instagram, I am not making money off of this project.

I am only doing it to practice my Frontend/Backend skills*.

*However, Instagram, if you see this and you like it, I'm looking for employement.
